  "lingoshelfBackground": "As a passionate language learner myself, I've encountered numerous challenges and setbacks on my language journey and I understand firsthand how daunting it can be to transition to native materials. When learners begin to gain confidence with their study materials, delving into books aimed at native speakers can feel intimidating and it often shows them how much there is still to learn. This often leads to negative emotions such as overwhelm and insecurity. To prevent these feelings, it's essential to help learners ease into native reading materials and seamlessly merge language learning with the joy of reading.",

  "lingoshelfUserFlowExplanation1": "Utilizing the functionalities defined during the 5WH questions, I created 4 different user flows representing the necessary steps for users to achieve their goals. In addition to the onboarding process, I outlined user flows for the book search, word saving during reading, and vocabulary flashcards.",

  "lingoshelfWireframesExplanation": "The wireframes I initially created, based on the user flows, were minimal, focusing solely on essential flows and functionalities. Through further iterations, I refined the screen layouts and developed a visual style for the app. Given that the app aims to create an immersive environment for language learners to focus on improving their skills, the visual design is intentionally minimal and unobtrusive, allowing users to concentrate on their reading content without distractions.",

  "lingoshelfHeadingUsability": "Uncovering Usability Problems",

  "lingoshelfUsabilityExplanation": "With my high-fidelity wireframes, I created prototypes to test with users and collect their feedback for further improvements. The user tests revealed that users had difficulties understanding the flashcards correctly. They were unsure how to input, receive feedback, or evaluate their answers using the colored buttons. Since this presented a significant usability issue that could result in a poor user experience, I iterated on ideas to better inform the user about what was happening.",

  "lingoshelfHeadingUsabilityProblem1": "Problem 1",

  "lingoshelfUsabilityProblem1": "Users were uncertain about the input method and how to receive feedback on their answers.",

  "lingoshelfHeadingUsabilitySolution1": "Solution 1",

  "lingoshelfUsabilitySolution1": "I added the text 'Tab to reveal the answer' at the bottom of the screen to cue users to flip the card and reduce ambiguity.",

  "lingoshelfUsabilityProblem2": "Users were unsure about the purpose of the colored buttons on the bottom on the screen.",

  "lingoshelfHeadingUsabilitySolution2": "Solution 2",

  "lingoshelfUsabilitySolution2": "To address this issue, I introduced two distinct solutions to improve the flashcard experience at different stages of the flow.",

  "lingoshelfUsabilitySolution3": "User testing revealed that not everyone is familiar with SRS-based flashcards. That is why I decided to introduce an additional screen to explain SRS when users access their flashcards for the first time.",

  "lingoshelfUsabilitySolution4": "The second solution mirrors the approach taken for the first problem: I added a cue directly on the screen to remind users of the buttons' functionality.",

  "lingoshelfLearning1": "Being a part of the product's target audience yourself can provide an advantage as it allows you to empathize better with the user's perspective. However, it can also be a disadvantage as it may make you more susceptible to biases based on your own preferences. Therefore, it is crucial to remain aware of these biases and be willing to set aside personal preferences when user research and testing reveal different needs and preferences.",

  "lingoshelfHeadingLearning2": "Consider users who may not appear to be your target audience at first glance",

  "lingoshelfLearning2": "To avoid designing in isolation and excluding individuals who may have less experience with language learning, it is essential to involve people from diverse backgrounds in both the research and design phases. This approach yields valuable insights and prevents the pitfall of designing exclusively for one specific group",

The onboarding process should be both intuitive and trustworthy, considering the app deals with sensitive data. The transaction flow needs to be swift and straightforward, avoiding unnecessary complexity, as users are likely to use this feature daily. Lastly, the saving goal flow should be engaging and motivating, encouraging users to persist in their money-saving journey and ultimately achieve their goals.",
